# üéÆ HaloCE Gametype Editor üéÆ
A fully-featured gametype editor for Halo Custom Edition.

This tool was created to edit the native gametype format for Halo (blam.lst) with greater ease and flexibility.
It allows for custom values to be set, as well as fixing an issue the original game has when creating a Capture The Flag gametype where the score limit is always set to 1.

This tool provides great flexability by using the advanced tab, allowing custom values to be set for most variables.
Some things outside of these ranges will work fine, but some may have unintended consequnces; the details pages in the advanced view will be updated with more detailed information in time.
