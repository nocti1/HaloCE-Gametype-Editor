# HaloCE Gametype Editor
A fully-featured gametype editor for Halo Custom Edition.

This tool lets you edit the native gametype format for Halo (blam.lst) with an easy interface.
It allows for custom values to be set as well as fixing an issue the original game has when creating a Capture The Flag gametype with more than 1 score limit; it gives you enough control to potentially break the gametype too, so keep that in mind.
In the future I intend to implement a warnings system to notify you if you've set values outside of ranges that would be possible in the normal game.

HaloCE Gametype Editor features 2 main viewing modes: a normal view (an interface that mimics the original game), and the advanced view, which allows you to set almost any value in most fields.
